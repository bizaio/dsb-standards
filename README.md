# Consumer Data Standards Redocs

This repository contains a [Redoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc) implementation of the [Consumer Data Standards](https://consumerdatastandardsaustralia.github.io/standards) governing the [Consumer Data Right](https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/consumer-data-right-cdr-0).

## Current Status

We believe this documentation is currently up to date with *1.3.0* of the Standards with respect to the payloads.

We have not currently transferred auxillary documentation outside of payloads.

## Maintainers

[Biza Pty Ltd](https://biza.io/) are currently the primary maintainers of this repository and will endeavour to keep it up to date with the upstream specifications.
