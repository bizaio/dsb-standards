    type: string
  unitOfMeasure:
    description: >-
      The unit of measure that applies to the tierValueMinimum and
      tierValueMaximum values e.g. a **DOLLAR** amount. **PERCENT** (in the case
      of loan-to-value ratio or LVR). Tier term period representing a discrete
      number of **MONTH**'s or **DAY**'s (in the case of term deposit tiers)
    enum:
      - DOLLAR
      - PERCENT
      - MONTH
      - DAY
    type: string
  applicabilityConditions:
    $ref: ./BankingProductRateConditionV1.yaml
  maximumValue:
    description: >-
      The number of tierUnitOfMeasure units that form the upper bound of the
      tier or band. For a tier with a discrete value (as opposed to a range of
      values e.g. 1 month) this must be the same as tierValueMinimum. Where this
      is the same as the tierValueMinimum value of the next-higher tier the
      referenced tier should be exclusive of this value. For example a term
      deposit of 2 months falls into the upper tier of the following tiers: (1 –
      2 months, 2 – 3 months). If absent the tier's range has no upper bound.
    type: number
  minimumValue:
    description: >-
      The number of tierUnitOfMeasure units that form the lower bound of the
      tier. The tier should be inclusive of this value
    type: number
  rateApplicationMethod:
    description: >-
      The method used to calculate the amount to be applied using one or more
      tiers. A single rate may be applied to the entire balance or each
      applicable tier rate is applied to the portion of the balance that falls
      into that tier (referred to as 'bands' or 'steps')
    enum:
      - WHOLE_BALANCE
      - PER_TIER
