      The number of tierUnitOfMeasure units that form the upper bound of the
      tier or band. For a tier with a discrete value (as opposed to a range of
      values e.g. 1 month) this must be the same as tierValueMinimum. Where this
      is the same as the tierValueMinimum value of the next-higher tier the
      referenced tier should be exclusive of this value. For example a term
      deposit of 2 months falls into the upper tier of the following tiers: (1 –
      2 months, 2 – 3 months). If absent the tier's range has no upper bound.
